Project: Recipes 

In this project, I will create a basic recipe website, which will consist of a main index page that links to a few recipes. 

By the end of this project, I will demonstrate a basic understanding of HTML and Git by:
    1. Creating a project repository, and committing meaningful changes.
    
    2. Creating relevant project directories and files including a recipe directory and an index.html file. 

    3. Utilizing boilerplate HTML containing headings, a link, image, paragraphs, unordered list, ordered list.
