        <h2> Injera: An Ethiopian Fermented Flatbread </h2>
        <p> According to Wikipedia, "Injera (Amharic: እንጀራ, romanized: ənǧära, [ɨndʒəra]; Tigrinya: ጣይታ, romanized: ṭayta; Oromo: budeena) is a sour fermented pancake-like flatbread with a slightly spongy texture, traditionally made of teff flour." </p>
        <p> Wikipedia continues, "In Ethiopia and Eritrea, [1][2] injera is a staple. Injera is central to the dining process in Amhara community, like bread or rice elsewhere and is usually stored in the mesob." This recipe will explain how to cook Injera. However, for details on how to prepare the Injera batter including Ersho and Asbit, please see teffco.com. </p>

        <h3> How to Cook Injera </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Once the small bubbles develop, your batter is now ready to cook. Pour off any top water, that has separated, into a bowl and set aside to add back if needed for desired consistency. You do not want to add pure water at this stage as it will dilute the fermentation. </li>
                <li> Heat your non-stick cooking surface to medium-high. If using a 16″ Wass Mitad/Mogago, we have found 250°F works well. Some, however, prefer 350°F so just test your cooking surface until you find the right temperature for you. </li>
                <li> For the first injera, use less batter to check the bubble formation (aka “eyes”) – about 500ml-600ml of the batter is equal to 1 large 16” injera. </li>
                <li> Once about 80% of the eyes have formed, cover with a lid. </li>
                <li> Remove lid about 30 seconds after steam begins to come out around the edges of the lid. The edges of the injera should have started lifting off the cooking surface. </li>
                <li> Slide a thin, heat-safe, mat under the injera and use it to slowly lift the injera from the grill. Set aside and let cool while you work on your next injera. </li>
                <li>Once the injera has cooled for a couple minutes on the mat, you can now move it to your serving surface. Wait for the injera to cool down entirely before stacking to avoid sticking.</li>
                <li> Top with desired stews and enjoy!</li>
